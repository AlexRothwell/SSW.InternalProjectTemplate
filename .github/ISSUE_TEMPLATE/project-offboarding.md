To myself,
  
I will be leaving the {{ PROJECT NAME }} project and need to complete offboarding. I need to do the following steps:

- [ ] Finish current work and get into a state that's complete or ready for handover
- [ ] Ensure uncommitted code is committed to remote
- [ ] Handover unfinished tasks
- [ ] Ensure current PBIs are assigned to another team member
