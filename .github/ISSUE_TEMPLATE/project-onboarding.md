To myself,
  
I'm joining the {{ PROJECT NAME }} project and need to get onboarded. I need to do the steps below:

- [ ] Ask the Product Champion to add me to the project's Scrum ceremonies
- [ ] Clone this repo locally
- [ ] Follow the F5 experience steps in README.md
- [ ] Pick up a task tagged `good-first-task` and complete it according to the Definition of Done
- [ ] Get up to date on the project by following [this Rule](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/how-to-see-what-is-going-on-in-your-project/)
- [ ] Get some PBIs assigned to me and start contributing to the Sprint
